Tidy data has a specific structure:
  Each variable is a column
  Each observation is a row
  Each type of observational unit is a table
  
Tidy text format is a table with one token per row

A token is meaningful unit of text, such as word

Tokenization is the process of splitting text into tokens

The token that is tored in each row is most often a single word, but also can be n-gram, sentence, or paragraph

String vs Corpus vs Document-term Matrix
String: Text can be stored as strings and often text data is first read into memory in this form;
Corpus: These types of objects typically contain raw strings annotated with additional metadata and details
Document-term Matrix:
This is a sparse matrix describing a collection of documents with one row for each doment and one column for each term. The value in the matrix is typically word count or tf-idf

A tibble is a modern class of data frame that has convenient print method, will not convert strings to factors, and does not use row names
