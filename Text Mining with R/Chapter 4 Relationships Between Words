token = "ngrams" argument which tokenizes by pairs of adjacent words rather than by individual ones

widyr, newe package, calculates pairwise correlations and distances within a tidy data frame

Pairs of consecutive words might capture structure that isn't present when one is just count single words, and may provide context that makes tokens more understandable

However, the per-bigram counts are also sparser: a typical two-word pair is rarer than either of its component words. 

Tidy data is a useful structure for comparing between variables or grouping by rows, but it can be challenging to compare between rows

Most operations for finding pairwise counts or correlations need to turn the data into a wide matrix first

Examine correlation among words, which indicates how often they appear together relative to how often they appear separately
