Document-term matrix:
1. Each row represents one document
2. Each column represents one term
3. Each value contains the number of appearances of that term in that document

Since most pairings of document and term do not occur, DTMs are usually implemented as sparse matrices

These objects can be treated as though they were matrices, but are sotred ina more efficient format

DTM objects cannot be used directly with tidy tools

cast_sparse(): converting to a sparse matrix from the Matrix package
cast_dtm(): converting to a DocumentTermMatrix object from tm
cast_dfm(): converting to a dfm object from quanteda

Some data structures are designed to store document collections before tokenization, often called a "corpus"

A Corpus object is structured like a list, with each item containing both text and medata.
